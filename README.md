# CSC437 Project: Cal Poly Cookbook

This repository represents the steps took to build a working production model of the Cal Poly Cookbook. 

The Cal Poly Cookbook is a web application where students can post and search for recipes. These recipes are made by them, for them. This solves the problem of complex recipes made by professional chefs

The web app was developed with the lit framework, an express server, and deployed on Azure: https://calpoly-cookbook.azurewebsites.net/app/
